# Self-Driving Car Simulator with Trained Model.
## This repository contains the code and trained model for a self-driving car using the Udacity self-driving car simulator. The model labeled as "Model_4.h5" has shown the best results in autonomous mode.

# Overview
### In this project, we utilize the Udacity self-driving car simulator to train a deep learning model to drive a car autonomously in a simulated environment. 
### The trained model, labeled as "Model_4.h5," has demonstrated superior performance compared to other models.

# Training
### The training process involved collecting data from the simulated environment and training a deep learning model to predict steering angles based on the input images from the car's camera. The model architecture and training parameters may vary depending upon the dataset collected.
# Model Evaluation
### Model_4.h5 has been evaluated extensively in the Udacity self-driving car simulator and has shown robust performance across various scenarios, including straight roads, and curves.
